# synculpinha

This script was created in order to sync two different directories and all the files within, like a backup. All the files that are already there will be overwriten in case they are outdated, and the ones that cannot be found there will be moved as a new one. 

## How to use

./synculpinha MainDirectory SecundaryDirectory
